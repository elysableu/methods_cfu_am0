# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
  *I think that my work on these assignments went well.  I had a few challenges interpreting some of the langauge on the Ruby documentation site and because of this I believe I picked some methods that were a little simplier than some of the other ones I could ahve picked.  Overall, I feel confident and proud of my work in the final_practice document.  Creating my own methods was easier than I thought is was going to be as I learn the Ruby syntax.*
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
  *Using methods is my applications will provide me the power of using a series of commands as many times as I need to without having to copy those commands each time I use them.  This will overall increase mine and my applications efficiency.*
